# Combat Tracker

A lightweight combat tracker for table-top roleplaying games.


## About

Combat Tracker is an application that I developed as a personal project while completing my Cert IV and Diploma in advanced programming.

It is a WinForms application that is intended to be used by the game master at the table. I found that many combat trackers on the market required a large amount of input, such as using a database of spells and requiring each ability and dice roll to be entered into the program. This can take the users attention away from the game that's occuring on the table in front of them. So, I designed an alternative that is super light-weight, letting you play the game and only input what you would otherwise be scribbling on a piece of paper in front of you.

Combat Tracker is able to:

- Add and remove combatants, storing each player/NPC's hitpoint maximum, current hitpoints, concentration, status effects and initiative order
- Automatically sort the combatants by initiative and highlight the current turn
- Apply damage and healing to combatants
- Prompt for a concentration check when a concentrating combatant takes damage
- Notify the user when a combatant drops below 0 HP
- Add and remove status effects
- Save and load game states, allowing the user to switch between multiple battles between sessions

... and that's it! Enjoy your game and never miss a concentration check again. 

## How To Use

The executable is found in Combat Tracker/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/Combat Tracker.exe

The save files are located in the /Saves/ folder in the same location.
